                A <a href=https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy>community developed</a>
                An open source community developed Python 3.6+ package for plasma physics
                in the early stages of development.

                PlasmaPy intends to be for plasmas
                what <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy">Astropy</a>
                is for astronomy - a collection of functionality commonly
                used and shared between plasma physicists and researchers globally,
                running within and leveraging the open source scientific Python ecosystem.
                The goals of this project are more thoroughly described in our
